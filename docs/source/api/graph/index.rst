Ontology to graph
=============================

In this module we provide different methods for projecting an ontology into a graph: The methods we provide are:


Ontology Projection
------------------------------------

.. automodule:: mowl.graph.graph
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:


All the methods will return a list of edges corresponding to the **Edge** class:

.. include:: edge.rst

      
.. include:: subclass.rst
.. include:: subclassRels.rst
.. include:: dl2vec.rst
.. include:: owl2vec.rst
